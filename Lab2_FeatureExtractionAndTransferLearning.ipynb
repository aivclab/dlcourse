A pre-trained network is simply a saved network previously trained on a large dataset, such as the [ImageNet dataset](http://www.image-net.org/) (1.4 million labeled images and 1000 different classes). If this original dataset is large enough and general enough, then the spatial feature hierarchy learned by the pre-trained network can effectively act as a generic model of our visual world, and hence its features can prove useful for many different computer vision problems, even though these new problems might involve completely different classes from those of the original task.\n",

        "Traditional CNNs are divided into two parts: they start with a series of convolution and pooling layers, and they end with a densely-connected classifier. The first part is often referred to as the \"encoder\", \"feature extractor\" or \"convolutional base\" of the model. In the case of CNNs, \"feature extraction\" will simply consist of taking the convolutional base of a previously-trained network, running the new data through it, and training a new classifier on top of the output.

        "1. In the above example we have not optimized the pre-trained weights of the convolutional base (i.e., the encoder). To improve performance further you could enable training in all layers (including the convolutoinal base) and re-train the network. This is called *fine-tuning*.\n",
        "2. Another way to improve model performance is by *data augmentation*. Have a look at the documentation for the [image generator class](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/) and see what kind of augmentation is possible. Why do you think data augmentation helps improve the performance of your model?\n",
        "3. Try repeating the above experiments on the MNIST dataset. Take a look here: https://keras.io/examples/mnist_cnn/"
